Next v1.4 (folders and records):
- change name, add, and delete records / folders

- switch between folders and records will alter the what's in the tab-content box

issue:
- when creating new itemButtons from calls to "addFolder", I'd like to highlight the itemButton right after creation
for I can't do it during creation, as the specific <elem> has not been created yet.
