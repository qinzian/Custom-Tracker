personal project4: custom tracker

Next v3.3 (summary):
- make things a bit more pretty / less ugly

Additions:
- databind to TabsSelector's $scope var to highlight tabs upon page loading (also to replace the JQuery highlight soln)

- <helper> section's msgs and info

- create my own prompt() method that shows a pop up window (by using css animation, this will help improve UX)

Issue:
-

* since github preview doesn't work with angular scripts, feel free to view this 
  project by downloading the whole package and open up "index.html"
