Next v2.5 (forms):
- create templates in viewer that's based on info in form obj to make records

- use databinding on DOM's class so that <a> with default labels don't appear

- remove Record.components; instead use databinding on the Form obj to create a template with ng-model
(The information can be acquired by going through all the ng-models and saving in Record obj.details)
